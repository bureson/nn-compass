 - Title: Dilemma 1: Your specialist wants to pursue another career

 - Next: dilemma2


# Description
Lone has been working in your team for the past two years. She's highly skilled and the only one who knows how to manage a core process in your team. 

Your team has been very busy this past year, so you haven't had a chance to plan how her knowledge is going to be shared with the rest of the team. 

During a dialogue with Lone you are surprised to learn that she wants to move into a leadership role in a different part of Novo Nordisk. 

Based on your experience working with her, you don't think she'd be a good fit for a leadership role; she really struggles to delegate work and set direction. Lone tells you that she's strongly considering applying for the leadership position and she would like you to be her referral. 

How do you respond?


# Choice
I sit down with Lone to get a better understanding of her motivations for pursuing a new career path. I'm honest about how I experience her leadership skills and suggest that she gets some training in the needed skills. However, if she decides to go ahead and apply for the leadership position I will not stand in her way. I accept to be her referral but let her know that I will have to share my concerns if I'm asked to provide a reference. I also ask her to work with me and the team over the next three months, in case she get the job, to ensure that her knowledge about the core process is transferred to the team before she leaves.

# Feedback
Thumbs-up for your transparency and sincerity! It's great that you give Lone your honest feedback about how you see her leadership potential - or lack of - while also paying attention to her career aspirations and the business' goals. Keep in mind that Lone might decide to stay in your team. In that case, consider how to handle her development and keep providing her your sincere feedback.  

This is a dilemma of balancing how you develop your team members, provide sincere feedback and keep the business running.



# Choice
I sit down with Lone and decide to give her my sincere feedback. I tell her that I cannot be her referral and exemplify why I don't think she's ready yet. 
I suggest that we develop a detailed six-month plan for her to get exposure to and training in the needed leadership skills. If she still wants to take on a leadership role after these six months, and has demonstrated growth, I will be happy to give her my full support and be her referral. 
Getting Lone to stay in my team for a few more months would also buy me time to get the rest of the team more familiar with the core process.

# Feedback
Great decision. It's always good to be curious about your employees' development goals, and offer constructive and sincere feedback. One possible challenge is that by committing to developing Lone's leadership skills over the next six months you might reduce your team's productivity, as Lone will not be fully focused on her core tasks. You will have to spend additional resources developing her leadership skills.

# Choice
Lone is a valuable team member and I would hate to see her leave. I sit down with her and ask her in more detail about her motivation to pursue a leadership role. Perhaps there are opportunities for her to stay in my team and take on more informal leadership responsibilities that we haven’t explored yet.

# Feedback
It's good that you are curious about Lone's development goals and invite her to think about solutions within your team. This could be the best course of action, but you should be prepared that Lone may still want to leave your team. In that case, think about ways to offer her sincere and constructive feedback and consider how to minimise the impact of her departure on your team's productivity and critical processes.
